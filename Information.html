				They like to consume the sap from the trees. This option may catch you off guard. We think of butterflies as beautiful creatures who would never eat 
				something we would consider disgusting. We were mistaken, butterflies will flock to your home to drink the liquid from a pile of rotting animal feces.</p></center>
